<p class="message">
This website was set up after not renewing the domain 
<a href='http://lyndonarmitage.com'>lyndonarmitage.com</a> 
which had previously been bought by domain squatters, it now redirects to 
<a href='https://lyndon.codes'>lyndon.codes</a>.
</p>

The main purpose of this site is to showcase various pieces of technical 
knowledge and things I (Lyndon Armitage) find interesting.

## Work

My primary experience is with developing Java/JVM based Big Data solutions
although I have experience working with a full range of web technologies as
well.

I am currently employed as a Senior Data Engineer at [Holland and
Barrett](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/) where I work with Big Data using
technologies including  Databricks, Datadog, Apache Spark, Kafka, Scala, S3,
Redshift, RDS, Glue, and lots of other parts of AWS.

Up until June 2019 I was working as a Full Stack Developer at 
[Synoptic Technologies Ltd](https://www.synoptica.com/) based in Guildford, UK. 
Where I worked primarily on the back-end of their AI technologies that power 
their platform Synoptica; using technologies including Apache Spark, Spring, 
Elasticsearch, Eclipse Vert.x, Apache NiFi, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, 
PostgreSQL, Kotlin, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and many more.

Before working at Synoptic I  worked at 
[BAE Systems Applied Intelligence](https://www.baesystems.com/en/cybersecurity/home) 
(formally Detica) on various projects involving Big Data technologies such as 
Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, MySQL, as well 
as several in-house tools and storage solutions.

Previous to BAE I worked at a small software company called 
[IDR Solutions](https://www.idrsolutions.com/) who specialise in Java and Web 
based PDF solutions. There I primarily used Java, JavaScript and HTML5 with 
some exposure to application servers such as GlassFish. They maintain a great 
[blog](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/) with technical posts on related topics 
that I highly recommend.

## Website Source

This website is built upon the static site generator [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
and the theme [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) which is a project based on the
[Poole](https://github.com/poole) example theme.

After having used Wordpress in the past for my original blog I opted for 
something different which should hopefully be simpler to maintain and add 
content to.

The source code to this site is currently maintained on GitHub at:
