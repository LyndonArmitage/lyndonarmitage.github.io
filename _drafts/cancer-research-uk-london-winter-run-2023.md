I will be running in the Cancer Research London Winter Run on February 5th 2023.
This is a 10KM run around various sites in London in aid of helping fun
research into Cancer treatments.

Over the last year I have got back into running, mostly during my lunch time
and only for a distance of about 5KM so this run will be a little bit of a
challenge for me! Especially after mildly spraining my ankle during my training
on the 9th of January! Thankfully, I was able to complete a 5KM run today, so I
am definitely going to give it my all on the 5th.

If you could spare some change please donate at my
[fundraising page](https://www.winterrun.co.uk/fundraisers/LyndonArmitage),
even just Â£5 can make a difference in the fight against cancer!
