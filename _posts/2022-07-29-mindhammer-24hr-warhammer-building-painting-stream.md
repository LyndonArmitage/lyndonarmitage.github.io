This weekend, starting at 3pm on Saturday, I will be taking part in a charity
event at the [Geek Retreat](https://geek-retreat.uk/) in Woking. We will be
building and painting a full force of Warhammer or Warhammer 40,000 models.

The event is in aid of the Mind, a mental health charity who work across
England and Wales, giving support and advise to those in their times of need.

This is going to be a fun event: there's a dozen of us each building and
painting a small army from scratch, taking part in various forfeits based on
the amount of money we raise (at time of writing we're already over Â£1300), and
there will be some raffles of rare Warhammer and Warhammer 40K models.
