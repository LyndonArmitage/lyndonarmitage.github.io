So it's two weeks into 2023's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and I
have a confession to make. I've been using it to learn
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

In my [last post]({% post_url 2023-12-01-adventofcode-2023 %}) I mentioned I'd
try to use Advent of Code to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) only to flounder
at the first hurdle. So I settled on improving my
[Python](https://www.python.org/) skills.

Well, in those two weeks I decided to still try my hand at a new programming
language, and settled on looking at Rust. A language I had initially looked at
some time between 2016 and 2018 but not really paid much attention to since
then. I knew it was touted as a "safe" replacement for C/C++, and that it had a
novel system for managing memory that was both manual (so no garbage
collection like Scala) but also automatic (through some clever systems related
to ownership of variable).

Part of what attracted me to Rust was what had turned me off of Zig, the state
of its documentation and tooling; [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) is
a fantastic package manager and build tool, with an ergonomic CLI interface and
configuration file (it uses TOML, which I have mentioned [before on this
blog]({% post_url 2018-06-21-vertx-config-toml %})), there is an LSP that works
flawlessly with Cargo and NeoVim called
[rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/), and there's more
[documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
[online](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html) than you
can [shake](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) a [stick
at](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).

With all that said, how am I finding Advent of Code 2023 so far? And how am I
finding doing it in Python and Rust?

As of time of writing I have done 9 out of the available 13 days, and will
break down each one in brief.

## Day 1

[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) was an easy enough challenge, and
became a little harder in part 2 thanks to a gotcha related to the fact that
numbers as words can overlap. For instance `eightwothree` represents the
sequence `[8, 2, 3]`.

I spent a little time confused with my Python solution, due to a typo, and went
slightly mad thinking there was a scoping issue with a variable (curse of
weakly typed languages). Eventually, I used a Regular Expression to do the
parsing.

For part 2 I made a silly mistake and forgot to allow the last character of
each substring I was searching for from being the beginning of another word (the
gotcha I mentioned).

I mentioned on
[Twitter](https://x.com/LyndonArmitage/status/1730917079211987455?s=20) and
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@lyndon/111510702737996213) that aspects of
this question could make up a good interview question. I even produced a fun
little graph of how the word based numbers can flow into each other:


<img 
    title="The graph of Day 1 words"
    alt="A bidirectional graph/tree showing the connections between the words for 1 to 4 and which ones connect based on their last and first letter.
\- seven is connected to nine
\- nine is connected to eight
\- five is connected to eight
\- eight is connected to two and three
\- three is connected to eight
\- two is connected to one
\- one is connected to eight"

/>

Eventually, this was the first question I repeated in Rust on the evening of
December 4th.

## Day 2

[Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) was a lot easier than day 1 for
me. I found no real gotchas in it.

Again, like day 1, I used Regular Expressions to do the parsing, although it is
easy enough to do it without them. Which is exactly what I did when I repeated
this question in Rust.

## Day 3

[Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) was a little harder than day 2. It
involved building what was essentially a 2D map of the input file.

I struggled a little, but when I was solving it I was not at my usual desk and
had a lot of distractions in the environment. I put off the part 2 to the next
morning and thought of a much nicer way of storing the data. At some point I'd
like to redo part 1 but I am in no rush.

## Day 4

[Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4) part 1 was very straightforward,
just an act of parsing the input data, then generating a score based on it.
With the score happening to be 2 to the power of the number of matching numbers
minus 1.

Part 2 was a little more involved but not complex. It suits recursion perfectly
but, in Python especially, I was worried about stack overflows with the input
data so reached for a stack/queue based solution.

## Day 5

[Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/day/5) part 1 was pretty easy to solve, you
have input seeds and a whole load of ranges to map them through to get the
results.

The example given was small, and easy to process since it only had 4 values and
very small maps. So initially, I went for a naive approach where I generated
all the possible values in each range and what they mapped to. Which worked
great on the example input data. However, as soon as I plugged in the real
input data I was maxing out my memory!

So to solve this memory issue with my naive approach I redid the map ranges to
just store the ranges and had a class that simply mapped the input across these
without instantiating millions of values. That solved part 1.

Unfortunately, it didn't solve part 2, even though it would essentially be
`O(n)` in Big O notation. That's because part 2 reveals that there are many
millions of seed values. So, even with a linear algorithm, processing that many
items would take a very long time! For me these ranges added up to a total of
1,844,955,419 seeds, which would take 21 days working at 1 seed per
millisecond!

I considered parallelising the existing code, but that would only cut the
processing time down to a few days. Still not good enough!

Re-reading the question:

> What is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial
> seed numbers?

And looking at the input gave me an epiphany. Everything is a range. So I don't
need to map each individual seed value. I just need to map all the ranges!

I came up with the following:

1. We have an initial set of `n` ranges
2. At each stage, each range has a function applied to it that alters it's start
  and end values or splits it into multiple ranges
3. We repeat step 2 until we have no more stages
4. We take our set of ranges and just take the minimum from them

This reduces the average amount of overall calculations to approximately `n`,
ignoring the constants. In a worst case, we could have ranges of size 1 for
many input seeds, and every stage would need that many map steps. But
thankfully, all these ranges are linear, so that can't actually happen if we
add an optimization to merge contiguous ranges together.

So revising the above pseudo-steps into working on the whole set of ranges at
each stage, I came up with the following:

1. We have an initial set of `n` ranges
2. We merge any contiguous ranges in our set into single ranges
3. For the current stage, apply the mappings to the ranges, including any
   implied mappings. This can split the sets up.
4. Repeat step 3 and 4 until there are no more stages

I ended up implementing this in Rust more easily than Python, and it worked in
far less than 21 days!

Because this was quite hard to visualise without diagrams I turned to
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and created the following:

    alt="A complex diagram detailing the example input"
    src='{{ "assets/adventofcode/worked-ranges-example.png" | absolute_url }}'
    class='blog-image'
/>

The above is a part way worked example of how ranges travel through the given
example data.

And below is a simplified version of a seed range going through each of the
mapping ranges:

    alt="A simple example of a seed range being transformed by each map range"
    src='{{ "assets/adventofcode/converting-ranges.png" | absolute_url }}'
    class='blog-image'
/>

It's important that the ranges are ordered sequentially for mapping so when
split you can safely ignore the left range.

## Day 6

I didn't take many notes on [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/day/6), probably
because it frustrated me.

I only solved it in Python. Part 1 was easy, but part 2 required use of the
Quadratic Formula, which I recognised straight away, but I haven't used in at
least a decade. Ultimately, after a lot of searching, reading and tinkering, I
got it working.

## Day 7

Again, I took little notes for [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/day/7) and only
solved it in Python.

I used enumerated types in Python, and the `Counter` data type. Parsing the
data wasn't too hard, and nor was telling which hand was which. Most of the
problems I had stemmed from forgetting to add the five of a kind hand to the
initial set of a possible hands, and then doing something similar in Part 2
when upgrading the hands with the wild cards.

## Day 8

[Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/day/8) was fun. I completed it all in Rust
with no Python implementation, which is probably how I will continue with the
other questions going forward.

Part 1 was straightforward, but, much like day 5, it became more complicated in
part 2.

My intuition was to parse the data into a nice node data structure, with each
node having an id, a left and right field for the next node and a node type. I
didn't actually create a full graph, but instead used a [Hash
Map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) to store
all the nodes in based on their ids.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Hash, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum NodeType {
    Start,
    End,
    Normal,
}

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
struct Node {
    id: String,
    left: String,
    right: String,
    node_type: NodeType,
}
```

Part 1 was a case of iterating along the instructions until encountering the
exit node `ZZZ`. With the structures I used this was simple.

Part 2, at first glance, looks as simple as Part 1. It is, but it factors out
very fast. In the data I had, there were 6 starting nodes, so 6 nodes to check
every loop. However, they don't sync up on end nodes for billions of
iterations.

<img 
    title="The example given for part 2 as diagram showing which nodes go where"
    src='{{ "assets/adventofcode/example-nodes.png" | absolute_url }}'
    class='blog-image'
/>

I initially wrote some code that got up to 720 million iterations. This took a
long time, and wasn't even the final answer. So, looking at the data structure
I realised a few things:

- This is a closed, balanced graph, so all nodes always reach another one
- The question guarantees that all start nodes eventually will connect to end
  nodes
- Given the volume of data, there must be closed loops, and because all nodes
  eventually connect to end nodes, these loops must have valid end nodes within
  them

So instead of iterating and checking every iteration if all 6 nodes are end
nodes, I can simply identify each closed loop for each node. Then I can find
the lowest common multiplier between all of their lengths and that is my
answer.

This took a little bit of trial and error in Rust to write. I mostly got
confused on how to recognise the closed loops/cycles correctly. With that
eventually solved, I actually had to halve each iteration count because each
represented identifying the loop, which will be twice as a long as the actual
loop. Then with some simple [greatest common
divisor](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) and [lowest
common multiplier](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
functions I was done.

```rust
/// Find greatest common divisor
fn gcd(mut m: usize, mut n: usize) -> usize {
    while m != 0 {
        let old_m = m;
        m = n % m;
        n = old_m;
    }
    return n;
}

/// Find lowest common multiple
fn lcm(a: usize, b: usize) -> usize {
    a * b / gcd(a, b)
}
```

## Day 9

[Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/day/9) is the last challenge I have done at
time of writing. And as stated in Day 8, I only implemented it in Rust.

Part 1, like a lot of the challenges, was fairly easy. It just involves
building progressively smaller lists and then summing their new ending values.

Part 2, was also surprisingly easy, at least it was for me thanks to how I
structured my code from part 1. All I needed was a flag in my code to calculate
a similar value to part 1 just for the front of each
[Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) I used.

## Day 10+

Day 9 is all I have gotten up to right now, which puts me about 5 days behind.
Not too bad, all things considered. Especially, since I stopped at
Day 4 the last time I tried Advent of Code.

Overall, I am getting to grips with Rust as I go. I am still a bit fuzzy on the
way explicit
[lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html) work
within it, but I think Day 10 will give me cause to understand that more. I am
finding Rust to be quite an enjoyable language to build stuff in, thanks to its
excellent documentation and super helpful compiler error messages.

I think the speed at which I am getting to know how to use it can be attributed
to my knowledge of C and Scala. The low-level knowledge around memory and
pointers from C helps me parse how the borrow checker works, and the functional
aspects from Scala help me understand the structure of the Rust standard
library, including it's [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) and
[Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html) types.

Once Advent of Code 2023 is over I will make my solutions public on GitHub.
Until then, happy holidays!
