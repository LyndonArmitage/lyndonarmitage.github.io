So in my last post I lamented that I was getting only spam comments on my blog
after updating it with Staticman to enable comments so today I have decided to
disable comments altogether.

If you want to comment on any of my posts do so wherever they are shared or you
can email me about it and if I think it makes a worthwhile point I will update
posts with your comments.
