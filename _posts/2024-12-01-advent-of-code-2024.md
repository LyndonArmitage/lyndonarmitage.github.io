It's come again, [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/). I don't
think I have ever fully finished one of these, I probably came close in one of
the earlier ones during the 2010's.

Instead of polluting this blog with posts per day, I will do as I did in
[2023]({% post_url 2023-12-01-adventofcode-2023 %}) and post summaries and
interesting bits based on where I get to.

Last year, I tried to use Advent of Code to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
and ended up doing parts of it in [Rust]({% post_url
2023-12-13-adventofrust-2023 %}) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). This
year I am concentrating on my Python skills first and perhaps will return to
problems with another programming language later.

I've already completed Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024. It was a nice and simple
pair of challenges to get started, sorting lists and comparing values within
them. Nothing too complicated.

I would advise anyone doing these challenges to keep efficiency in the back of
their mind, because, in previous years, some of the inputs were quite large and
did not lend themselves very well to brute force approaches. Normally, the
challenges that require these efficient solutions are the second parts to each
day.

Below are links to each summary post I have made:

1. [Days 1 to 6]({% post_url 2024-12-06-advent-of-code-2024-summary-days-1-to-6
   %})
2. [Days 7 to 12]({% post_url
   2024-12-13-advent-of-code-2024-summary-of-days-7-to-12 %})
